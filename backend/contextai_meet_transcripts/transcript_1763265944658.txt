[00:00] Alice:
Okay team, quick sync. We need to finalize one feature for tomorrow’s demo.

[00:06] Bob:
I vote for showing the Deep Research mode. The 1000-word summary looks impressive.

[00:12] Charlie:
True, but it takes around 12 seconds. Should we instead show the moderate summary? It loads in 3 seconds.

[00:20] Diana:
Why not both? We can run moderate live, and show a pre-generated deep one.

[00:27] Alice:
Good idea. What about the Q&A feature? Should that be the final highlight?

[00:33] Bob:
Definitely. Asking “Who is responsible for the UI update?” and getting instant context will wow the judges.

[00:41] Charlie:
Then we’re settled:

Moderate summary live

Deep summary pre-render

Q&A showcase

[00:48] Diana:
I’ll prepare sample questions. Keep them simple and impactful.

[00:52] Alice:
Great. That’s it—back to work!
