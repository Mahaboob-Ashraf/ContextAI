[00:00] Alice:
Let’s do a quick review of the updated dashboard before we push it.

[00:05] Bob:
The summary cards look cleaner now. I reduced the text density and added the platform badges.

[00:12] Charlie:
Nice. Did you fix the spacing issue between the WhatsApp and Meets sections?

[00:17] Bob:
Yep, added a responsive grid. Works on mobile too.

[00:22] Diana:
I tested the “View Full” button. It’s smooth, but the transition animation feels a bit slow on older laptops.

[00:30] Alice:
We can lower the transition duration from 300ms to 200ms. Should speed things up.

[00:36] Charlie:
Also, the delete confirmation dialog needs a warning icon. Users didn’t notice the confirmation step.

[00:42] Bob:
Got it. I’ll add that now.

[00:45] Diana:
Everything else looks solid. I think we’re ready for the demo.

[00:49] Alice:
Perfect. Ship it.
