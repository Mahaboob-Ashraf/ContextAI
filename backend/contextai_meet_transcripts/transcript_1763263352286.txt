[00:00] Alice:
Good morning, everyone. Let’s quickly sync on our ContextAI progress. The hackathon is coming up, so we need a polished demo.

[00:12] Bob:
Yeah, I finished stabilizing the WhatsApp integration. We’re able to fetch all 340 chats consistently now, no random disconnects.

[00:25] Charlie:
Nice. Did you also fix the Puppeteer memory issue?

[00:31] Bob:
Yep. I added an auto-restart wrapper and reduced headless overhead. Sessions persist through .wwebjs_auth, so it’s smooth.

[00:48] Diana:
Great progress. I tested the RAG server yesterday. Retrieval works, but the event extraction still misses some decisions, especially when the phrasing is indirect.

[01:02] Alice:
Example?

[01:04] Diana:
Like “I think using React for the dashboard makes sense” — the model doesn’t classify it as a DECISION. It tags it as FACT.

[01:19] Charlie:
We can add a small rule-based post-processor. If multiple speakers agree in nearby messages, mark as DECISION.

[01:30] Alice:
Yes, let’s do that. Also—Deep Research mode is amazing, but it takes around 12 seconds. Is that acceptable for the demo?

[01:42] Bob:
I think so. Hackathon judges won’t mind a 10-second wait for a 1000-word intelligence summary.
