He also resolved the Puppeteer memory issue with an auto-restart wrapper and session persistence.\n*   **RAG Server & Event Extraction:** Diana reported that retrieval works well, but the event extraction model misses some decisions, particularly those phrased indirectly. An example was given where \"I think using React for the dashboard makes sense\" was misclassified as a FACT instead of a DECISION.\n*   **Deep Research Mode Performance:** Alice raised a concern about the 12-second latency of Deep Research mode, questioning its suitability for the demo. Bob believes this is acceptable for a hackathon demo, given the value of a 1000-word intelligence summary.\n\n**✅ Action Items**\n*   **Post-processor for Event Extraction:** Charlie proposed adding a rule-based post-processor to tag decisions more accurately, especially when speakers agree in nearby messages. Alice agreed to this.\n*   **Deep Research Mode Latency:** No specific action item was assigned, but the acceptable latency was discussed and implicitly agreed upon for the demo.\n\n**💡 Key Takeaways**\n*   The ContextAI project is nearing a polished state for the hackathon demo, with key technical hurdles addressed (WhatsApp integration, Puppeteer memory).\n*   A specific area for improvement remains in the RAG server's ability to accurately extract indirect decisions.\n*   The team is prioritizing demo functionality and acceptance of minor latency for key features.",
